Problem 22 - Names Score

Begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the 
alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical 
position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which 
is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN 
would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
